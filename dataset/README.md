# DiscreteSeq

Accompanying dataset for our paper at BlackBoxNLP 2021, [Controlled tasks for model analysis: Retrieving discrete information from sequences](https://aclanthology.org/2021.blackboxnlp-1.37/).

### Contents of the folder
* It contains one directory for each task introduced in the paper.
* Every directory contains an archived version of the training data (due to size), the validation data and the test data.


### Dataset description
The trainig data files contain 100k datapoints and both the validation and the test data contain 10k datapoints.


### Datapoint stucture
Each datapoint occupies 3 lines in the files.
- The first line contains the sequence input. It starts with the word `sequence` and it is followed by n binary vectors separated by tabs.
- The second line contains the query.  It starts with the word `query` and it is followed by the sentence `have you seen x` where x represents the position id of the queried feature.
- The third line contains the anwer. It starts with the word `answer` and it is followed by either `no` or `yes`.
